# Students-Performance-Analysis
Data analysis project using Python and NumPy to analyze student performance, class average, and overall results.


# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing students' academic performance using Python.
The analysis helps in understanding overall class performance, identifying top scorers,
and evaluating students based on their results.

This project is created as a part of my Data Science learning journey.


# Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Google Colab

# Key Analysis Performed
- Calculation of class average marks
- Identification of highest scoring students
- Detection of students above and below average
- Result-wise student filtering (Pass / Fail)
- Subject-wise and overall performance insights
  
# Project Structure
- `Students_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` : Main notebook containing analysis and logic

# Future Improvements
- Data visualization using Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Adding more statistical insights
- Applying machine learning models for performance prediction
